#### Overview

The whole idea is to use a `UITable`. The `onClick`-function offers 
the tapped row. With this information, giving  
every row its own action is possible. 

Scriptable offers a lot of functions; however, there are limitations, too.
It is impossible to update, insert, or delete rows in a `table`.
Therefore, there is a copy of the table called `rowsOfTable`.
`rowsOfTable` is an array that contains at least the following fields:
```
rowsOfTable: [{row:UITableRow, visible:bool, ...}]
``` 
Each entry of the array corresponds to a row of the table. 
Some entries contain more information. This information is 
used to perform the row action after tapping on it.

With `rowsOfTable`, it is possible to perform the update, insert, and delete
actions. We change only the `rowsOfTable`-array; after this every row 
in the table will be deleted and filled again with the rowsOfTable.

#### Files

##### allExercises.json

To ensure that the state of the app is saved (even after closing it), multiple files are needed.
`allExercises.json` contains all information about an exercise. 
Here is an overview of a workout (which can, for example 
is `2024.07.26 legs.json`) for legs:

```js
{
  "squats":// name of exercise
  {
   "repetitions":42,
   "weight": {
     "unit": "kg", // we want to save the unit
     "amount": 24
   },
   "time": "2024.07.26 15-49-31", // own formatter saved in Time.js
   "type": "maxWeight", // can be volume or other types too
   "gymLocations": "Kraft Station KÃ¶ln", // gym name
   "comment": ""
  },
  "leg curls": ...
}
```
and an overview of the `allExercises.json`:
```js
{
  "legs":// the key is a bodypart
  {
   "squats"://name of exercise
   {
     "count": 42, // how often this exercise was done
     "expanded": true, // if sets and rekords should be displayed
     "lastWorkout": // the information about the last workout
     {
      // sets of last exercise, see above for definition
     },
     "rekords": // rekords for this exercise are here
     {
      // here types of workout
      "maxWeight":
      {
        "amount": 99, "unit": "kg", "reps":1
      },
      "volume":
      {
        "amount": 1000, "unit": "kg*reps", "reps":1
      },
     }
   },
   ...
  },
  "chest": ...
}
```

Another concept is that `workoutsOfToday` this object contains the 
exercises of today for different bodyparts. These exercises were read 
from the filesystem. 
The location for saved workouts is `gym_workout/workouts/<year>`.

##### settings.json

Next to these files is the `settings.json` to save information that is not about the exercises. For example, when the app was opened the last time.

##### Create Installer.js

Scans the folder and creates an Installer file.

##### TrackRep!ðŸ’ª.js

The main file, which contains the main callback function, that is called 
after tapping on a row.


In summary, the front end is realized by the `UITable` and `rowsOfTable`.
The backend is realized by the `workoutsOfToday` to save the current exercise, and the `allExercises.json` is, for example, used to save if one exercise is expanded.




#### Naming Conventions

- workout: the whole process 
- bodypart: a muscle group, e.g. biceps, legs, ...
- exercise: for example biceps curls, push ups, ...
- repetition: movement from start point to end point and back to start point
- set: a set of repetitions between a pause
- isolated: every arm has its weight
- weight plates: this is a machine with weight plates
- lying: you lay with your back somewhere horizontal to the ground
- incline: upward movement
- decline: downward movement
- cable: cable machines without removable weight plates
- maxWeight: maximum weight
- volume training: reps times weight
